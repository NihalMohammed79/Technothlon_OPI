          <li>You will be given 3 hours to complete the event. This Event consists of 25 levels.</li>
          <li>There will be questions as well as games in which two teams will go against each other.</li>
          <li>There will be some levels where the two teams need to co-operate with each other to increase their scores.</li>
          <li>Each Level will have its own marks and deductions as well as set of instructions which will be given to you on the specific level.</li>
          <li>Your team might not be able to complete all levels by the end of the time, but your score when the time runs out will be considered as your final score.</li>
          <li>Some levels might require special information. So a long pdf file will be present on your computer, if you wish to refer it during the game.</li>
