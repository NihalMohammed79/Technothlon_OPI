            <h1>The Puzzle Of The Prison Doors</h1>
            <p>You have been incarcerated in a high-security prison for several nefarious crimes which we need not go into here. The warden, being a kindly logician, offers you a single chance to escape. You are blindfolded and given a choice of five doors, one of which leads to freedom and the other four to prison cells. You know that the doors are red, blue, green, yellow, and white; they are evenly spaced, each 2 paces from the next; and you are standing in front of the middle one.</p>
            <p>There is a guard standing by each door, and all five guards tell the truth (weren't expecting that, were you?). They make the following statements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The red door is somewhere to the left of the door leading to freedom.</li>
                <li>The blue door is not at either end.</li>
                <li>The green door is 3 doors away from the door leading to freedom (2 doors between them).</li>
                <li>The yellow door is adjacent to the door leading to freedom.</li>
                <li>The white door is the middle one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To find out how many paces you need to take to which side in order to be standing in front of the door to freedom, you need to answer the following two questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is the order of the coloured doors, left to right?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Which colour of door leads to freedom?</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may assume that all statements made about "left" and "right" refer to your left and right.</p>
